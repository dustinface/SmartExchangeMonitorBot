# SmartExchangeMonitor

Just a simple telegram bot to watch the status of the exchange's SMART wallets from Cryptopia, Coinexchange and HitBTC based on their APIs. If you use it you can check if their wallet/deposit/withdraw is currently active or not. You will also receive a notification when the status of one of them changes. I created this in a rush and have no plans to do any updates for it. So it might be possible that there are bugs but it worked fine till now...anyway no guarantee! You can type /start to subscribe and /status to get the last updated state.
